# CV-proposed-method-for-reducing-salt-and-pepper-noise
a proposed method for removing salt and pepper noise and comparing it  with median filter method. 
in this method instead of using the median statistical parameter I used mean of quantiles with a 0.3 radius which increased PSNR hugely!
this method also does not check for black and white pixels which means it works in fully dark or light areas.
